SVN-Notify-Filter-EmailFlatFileDB

SVN::Notify::Filter::EmailFlatFileDB converts Subversion account
names into email addresses, within the context of SVN::Notify.
The svnnotify script is often used within Subversion repository
post-commit hooks, to inform a development team via email about
changes to their source code.

This module is a filter for SVN::Notify, which will translate user
account names (e.g. "user1") into email addresses.  It does this
based on a colon-separated file, like a UNIX passwd file (or more
usefully) the AuthUserFile used by Apache.  The file path is specified
via the --account_file option to the svnnotify script, and the index
of the email field is specified via the --account_field option.

Thanks to David Wheeler for SVN::Notify.  (Obviously, this
module depends upon that.)
