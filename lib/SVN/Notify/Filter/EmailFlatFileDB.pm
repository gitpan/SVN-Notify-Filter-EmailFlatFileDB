=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is intended to work with SVN::Notify, as part of a subversion post-commit hook.

    svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" ..etc..  \
              --filter EmailFlatFileDB                   \
                    --account_file /x/x/x/users.db         \
                    --account_field 3

    with a text file like other UNIX/Apache password files:

       user1:xxx:xxx:user1@example.com
       user2:xxx:xxx:user2@example.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a filter for SVN::Notify, which will translate
user account names (e.g. "user1") into email address.  It does
this based on a colon-separated file, like a UNIX passwd file
(or more usefully) the AuthUserFile used by Apache.  The file
path is specified via the --account_file option to the svnnotify
script, and the index (zero-based) of the email field is specified via the
--account_field option.

You can use the module in conjunction with SVN::Notify::Filter::AuthZEmail
to completely remove the necessity of passing in --from and --to options
to the script.  (AuthZEmail will determine the account names for the
email recipients, and this module will translate the account names into
email addresses.)

(This module will remove --to entries that are empty.)


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 from

SVN::Notify filter callback function for the "from" email address.
By default, SVN::Notify uses the account name of the commit author.
This will translate that into the email address, based upon the
value in the database file.  Note that the svnnotify --from option
can also be used to override the default SVN::Notify behavior, and
this filter will not modify an email address if it is passed in.

=cut

# The first argument is the SVN::Notify object
# The second argument is the sender account name or address.

sub from {
  my ($notifier, $from) = @_;
  my $dbfield= $notifier->account_field;

  if ($debug) { print "EmailFlatFileDB From: $from ($dbfield)"; }

  # load database... I'm not sure if the order of from/to
  # is always going to be fixed
  if (! %allusers) {
    my $dbfile = $notifier->account_file;
    _loadPasswdDb($dbfile,\%allusers,$dbfield);
    if ($debug) { _writePasswdDb(\%allusers); }
  }

  ($from) = _translateEmails(\%allusers,$dbfield,$from);
  if ($debug) { print " translated to: $from\n"; }

  return $from;
}

=head2 recipients

SVN::Notify filter callback function to determine the email
addresses for the email recipients, based upon account names
passed to SVN::Notify.

Account names will be looked up via the flat-file database, but
any email addresses passed in will not be modified.  This allows
one to enter either account names or email address via the svnnotify
--to options.  Email addresses are distinguished from account names
if there is an '@' in the string.  Empty string account names will
be discarded.  (The SVN::Notify object requires a --to argument,
and an empty string account name is a workaround for that, for
filters that completely provide the recipient list.)

=cut


# The first argument is the SVN::Notify object
# The second argument is an array reference to the recipients.
sub recipients {
  my ($notifier, $recip) = @_;

  my $dbfield= $notifier->account_field;

  if ($debug) { print 'EmailFlatFileDB to: ' . join(',',@$recip) . "\n"; }

  # if the file hasn't been loaded yet, do so
  if (! %allusers) {
    my $dbfile = $notifier->account_file;
    _loadPasswdDb($dbfile,\%allusers,$dbfield);
    if ($debug) { _writePasswdDb(\%allusers); }
  }

  @$recip = _translateEmails(\%allusers,$dbfield,@$recip);

  return $recip;
}
